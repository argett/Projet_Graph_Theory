There is no cycle is the graph so we can compute the rank and the times :

The ranks are : 
The state 0 has the rank 0
The state 1 has the rank 3
The state 2 has the rank 2
The state 3 has the rank 2
The state 4 has the rank 1
The state 5 has the rank 2
The state 6 has the rank 1
The state 7 has the rank 1
The state 8 has the rank 3
The state 9 has the rank 4
The state 10 has the rank 2
The state 11 has the rank 5

There is a negative arc
The graph can't be scheduled
